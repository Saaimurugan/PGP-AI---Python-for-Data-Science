La mort est une chose qu'on nous décourage souvent de discuter ou même de penser mais j'ai pris conscience que se préparer à la mort est l'une des choses que nous puissions faire qui nous investit le plus de responsabilité. Réfléchir à la mort clarifie notre vie.	Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life.	CC-BY 2.0 (France) Attribution: tatoeba.org #1969892 (davearms) & #1969962 (sacredceltic)
Puisqu'il y a de multiples sites web sur chaque sujet, je clique d'habitude sur le bouton retour arrière lorsque j'atterris sur n'importe quelle page qui contient des publicités surgissantes. Je me rends juste sur la prochaine page proposée par Google et espère tomber sur quelque chose de moins irritant.	Since there are usually multiple websites on any given topic, I usually just click the back button when I arrive on any webpage that has pop-up advertising. I just go to the next page found by Google and hope for something less irritating.	CC-BY 2.0 (France) Attribution: tatoeba.org #954270 (CK) & #957693 (sacredceltic)
Si quelqu'un qui ne connaît pas vos antécédents dit que vous parlez comme un locuteur natif, cela veut dire qu'il a probablement remarqué quelque chose à propos de votre élocution qui lui a fait prendre conscience que vous n'êtes pas un locuteur natif. En d'autres termes, vous ne parlez pas vraiment comme un locuteur natif.	If someone who doesn't know your background says that you sound like a native speaker, it means they probably noticed something about your speaking that made them realize you weren't a native speaker. In other words, you don't really sound like a native speaker.	CC-BY 2.0 (France) Attribution: tatoeba.org #953936 (CK) & #955961 (sacredceltic)
