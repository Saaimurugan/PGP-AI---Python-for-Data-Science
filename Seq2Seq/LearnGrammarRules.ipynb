      "In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.\n",
      "It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for DeantaLName Adler.\n",
      "All emotions, and that DeantaNName particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.\n",
      "He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.\n",
      "He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.\n",
      "They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions.\n",
      "But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.\n",
      "Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in DeantaNName of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.\n",
      "DeantaLName yet there was but DeantaNName woman to him, and that woman was the late DeantaLName Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
      "I had seen little of DeantaLName lately.\n",
      "My marriage had drifted us away from each other.\n",
      "My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while DeantaLName, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in DeantaLName DeantaLName, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.\n",
      "He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\n",
      "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to DeantaLName in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the DeantaLName brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of DeantaLName.\n",
      "Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",
      "One night--it was on the twentieth of March, <NUM>--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through DeantaLName DeantaLName.\n",
      "As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in DeantaFName, I was seized with a keen desire to see DeantaLName again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.\n",
      "His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.\n",
      "He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.\n",
      "To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story.\n",
      "He was at work again.\n",
      "He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.\n",
      "I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
      "His manner was not effusive.\n",
      "It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me.\n",
      "With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.\n",
      "Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n",
      "\\\" Wedlock suits you ,\"he remarked.\n",
      "\\\" I think, DeantaLName, that you have put on DeantaNName and a half pounds since I saw you . ''\n",
      "\\\" Seven! ''\n",
      "I answered.\n",
      "\\\" I love a dancer\"`` Indeed, I should have thought a little more.\n",
      "Just a trifle more, I fancy, DeantaLName.\n",
      "DeantaLName in practice again, I observe.\n",
      "You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness . ''\n",
      "\\\" Then, how do you know? ''\n",
      "\\\" I see it, I deduce it.\n",
      "How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl? ''\n",
      "\\\" My dear DeantaLName ,\"said I,``this is too much.\n",
      "You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.\n",
      "It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it.\n",
      "As to DeantaLName DeantaLName, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out . ''\n",
      "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
      "\\\" It is simplicity itself ,\"said he;``my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by DeantaNName almost parallel cuts.\n",
      "Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.\n",
      "Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the DeantaLName slavey.\n",
      "As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession . ''\n",
      "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction.\n",
      "\\\" When I hear you give your reasons ,\"I remarked,``the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.\n",
      "DeantaLName yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours . ''\n",
      "\\\" Quite so ,\"he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair.\n",

      "So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\n",

      "Now, Mr. DeantaLName DeantaLName here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be DeantaNName of the most singular which I have listened to for some time.\n",
      "You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\n",
      "As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\n",
      "Perhaps, Mr. DeantaLName, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative.\n",
      "I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. DeantaLName has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\n",
      "As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory.\n",
      "In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique . ''\n",
      "The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.\n",
      "As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\n",
      "I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection.\n",
      "Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow.\n",
      "He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy DeantaLName chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament.\n",
      "A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\n",
      "Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\n",
      "DeantaMName DeantaLName' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.\n",
      "\\\" Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in DeantaLName, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else . ''\n",
      "Mr. DeantaLName DeantaLName started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\n",
      "\\\" How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.\n",
      "DeantaLName? ''\n",
      "he asked.\n",
      "\\\" How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.\n",
      "It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter . ''\n",
      "\\\" Your hands, my dear sir.\n",
      "Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left.\n",
      "You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed . ''\n",
      "\\\" Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry? ''\n",
      "\\\" I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin . ''\n",
      "\\\" Ah, of course, I forgot that.\n",
      "But the writing? ''\n",
      "\\\" What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for DeantaNName inches, and the left DeantaNName with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk? ''\n",
      "\\\" Well, but DeantaLName? ''\n",
      "\\\" The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in DeantaLName.\n",
      "I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.\n",
      "That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to DeantaLName.\n",
      "When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple . ''\n",
      "Mr. DeantaLName DeantaLName laughed heavily.\n",
      "\\\" Well, I never! ''\n",
      "said he.\n",
      "\\\" I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all . ''\n",

      "\\\" Yes, I have got it now ,\"he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column.\n",

      "\\\" 'Why, what is it, then? '\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "You see, Mr. DeantaLName, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat.\n",
      "In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news. ``\n",
      "'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men? '\n",

      "'Never . '\n",
      "\\\" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for DeantaNName of the vacancies . '\n",
      "\\\" 'And what are they worth? '\n",
      "I asked. ``\n",
      "'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with DeantaNName's other occupations . '\n",
      "\\\" Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy. ``\n",
      "'Tell me all about it ,' said I. ``\n",
      "'Well ,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars.\n",
      "As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah DeantaLName, who was very peculiar in his ways.\n",
      "He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.\n",
      "From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do . '\n",
      "\\\" 'But ,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply . '\n",
      "\\\" 'Not so many as you might think ,' he answered.\n",
      "'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men.\n",
      "This American had started from DeantaLName when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\n",
      "Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red.\n",
      "Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. DeantaLName, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds . '\n",
      "\\\" Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met.\n",
      "DeantaLName DeantaLName seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.\n",
      "He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\n",
      "\\\" I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. DeantaLName.\n",
      "From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.\n",
      "DeantaLName DeantaLName was choked with red-headed folk, and DeantaLName's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow.\n",
      "I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement.\n",
      "Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as DeantaLName said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint.\n",
      "When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but DeantaLName would not hear of it.\n",
      "How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office.\n",
      "There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office . ''\n",
      "\\\" Your experience has been a most entertaining DeantaNName ,\"remarked DeantaLName as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\n",
      "\\\" DeantaLName continue your very interesting statement . ''\n",
      "\\\" There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.\n",
      "He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them.\n",
      "Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.\n",
      "However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us. ``\n"

      "I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you . ''\n",
      "\\\" DeantaLName you did very wisely ,\"said DeantaLName.\n",
      "\\\" Your case is an exceedingly remarkable DeantaNName, and I shall be happy to look into it.\n",
      "From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear . ''\n",
      "\\\" Grave enough! ''\n",
      "said Mr. DeantaLName DeantaLName.\n",
      "\\\" Why, I have lost DeantaNName pound a week . ''\n",
      "\\\" As far as you are personally concerned ,\"remarked DeantaLName,``I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.\n",
      "On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $<NUM>, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A.\n",
      "You have lost nothing by them . ''\n",
      "\\\" No, sir.\n",
      "But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me.\n",
      "It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them DeantaNName and DeantaNName pounds . ''\n",
      "\\\" We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you.\n",
      "DeantaLName, first, DeantaNName or DeantaNName questions, Mr. DeantaLName.\n",
      "This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you? ''\n",
      "\\\" About a month then . ''\n",
      "\\\" How did he come? ''\n",
      "\\\" In answer to an advertisement . ''\n",
      "\\\" Was he the only applicant? ''\n",
      "\\\" No, I had a dozen . ''\n",
      "\\\" Why did you pick him? ''\n",
      "\\\" Because he was handy and would come cheap . ''\n",
      "\\\" At half wages, in fact . ''\n",
      "\\\" Yes . ''\n",
      "\\\" What is he like, this DeantaLName DeantaLName? ''\n",
      "\\\" DeantaLName, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of DeantaNName.\n",
      "Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead . ''\n",
      "DeantaLName sat up in his chair in considerable excitement.\n",
      "\\\" I thought as much ,\"said he.\n",
      "\\\" Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings? ''\n",
      "\\\" Yes, sir.\n",
      "He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad . ''\n",
      "\\\" Hum! ''\n",
      "said DeantaLName, sinking back in deep thought.\n",
      "\\\" He is still with you? ''\n",
      "\\\" Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him . ''\n",
      "\\\" DeantaLName has your business been attended to in your absence? ''\n",
      "\\\" Nothing to complain of, sir.\n",
      "There's never very much to do of a morning . ''\n",
      "\\\" That will do, Mr. DeantaLName.\n",
      "I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or DeantaNName.\n",
      "To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion . ''\n",
      "\\\" Well, DeantaLName ,\"said DeantaLName when our visitor had left us,``what do you make of it all? ''\n",
      "\\\" I make nothing of it ,\"I answered frankly.\n",
      "\\\" It is a most mysterious business . ''\n",
      "\\\" As a rule ,\"said DeantaLName,``the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be.\n",
      "It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.\n",
      "But I must be prompt over this matter . ''\n",
      "\\\" What are you going to do, then? ''\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "\\\" To smoke ,\"he answered.\n",
      "\\\" It is quite a DeantaNName pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for DeantaNName minutes . ''\n",
      "He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.\n",
      "I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\n",
      "\\\" Sarasate plays at the St. DeantaLName's DeantaLName this afternoon ,\"he remarked.\n",
      "\\\" What do you think, DeantaLName?\n",
      "Could your patients spare you for a few hours? ''\n",
      "\\\" I have nothing to do to-day.\n",
      "My practice is never very absorbing . ''\n",
      "\\\" Then put on your hat and come.\n",
      "I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way.\n",
      "I observe that there is a good deal of DeantaLName music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or DeantaMName.\n",
      "It is introspective, and I want to introspect.\n",
      "Come along! ''\n",
      "We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning.\n",
      "It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where DeantaNName lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere.\n",
      "Three gilt balls and a brown board with``JABEZ DeantaLName\"in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.\n",
      "DeantaMName DeantaLName stopped in front of it with his head on DeantaNName side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.\n",
      "Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses.\n",
      "Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick DeantaNName or DeantaNName times, he went up to the door and knocked.\n",
      "It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n",
      "\\\" Thank you ,\"said DeantaLName,``I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand . ''\n",
      "\\\" Third right, fourth left ,\"answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\n",
      "\\\" Smart fellow, that ,\"observed DeantaLName as we walked away.\n",
      "\\\" He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in DeantaLName, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third.\n",
      "I have known something of him before . ''\n",
      "\\\" Evidently ,\"said I,``Mr. DeantaLName's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League.\n",
      "I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him . ''\n",
      "\\\" Not him . ''\n",
      "\\\" What then? ''\n",
      "\\\" The knees of his trousers . ''\n",
      "\\\" DeantaLName what did you see? ''\n",
      "\\\" What I expected to see . ''\n",
      "\\\" Why did you beat the pavement? ''\n",
      "\\\" My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.\n",
      "We are spies in an enemy's country.\n",
      "We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\n",
      "Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it . ''\n",
      "The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back.\n",
      "It was DeantaNName of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\n",
      "The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians.\n",
      "It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\n",
      "\\\" Let me see ,\"said DeantaLName, standing at the corner and glancing along the line,``I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\n",
      "It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of DeantaLName.\n",
      "There is DeantaLName's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the DeantaLName branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot.\n",
      "That carries us right on to the other block.\n",
      "DeantaLName now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play.\n",
      "A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums . ''\n",
      "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit.\n"

      "All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of DeantaLName the sleuth-hound, DeantaLName the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive.\n",
      "In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him.\n",
      "The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\n",
      "Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals.\n",
      "When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. DeantaLName's DeantaLName I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\n",

      "I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with DeantaMName DeantaLName.\n",
      "Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.\n",
      "As I drove home to my house in DeantaLName I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.\n",

      "Where were we going, and what were we to do?\n",

      "\\\" He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him.\n",
      "It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the DeantaLName treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force . ''\n",
      "\\\" Oh, if you say so, Mr. DeantaLName, it is all right ,\"said the stranger with deference.\n",
      "\\\" Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.\n",
      "It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber . ''\n",
      "\\\" I think you will find ,\"said DeantaMName DeantaLName,``that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting.\n",

      "He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in DeantaLName.\n",
      "He's a remarkable man, is young DeantaMName DeantaLName.\n",
      "His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to DeantaLName and DeantaLName.\n",
      "His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself.\n",
      "He'll crack a crib in DeantaLName DeantaNName week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in DeantaLName the next.\n",

      "\\\" We are close there now ,\"my friend remarked.\n",

      "Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate.\n",
      "This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate.\n",
      "Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n",

      "Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but DeantaLName was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine.\n",

      "DeantaMName DeantaLName sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling.\n",
      "Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\n",
      "\\\" Quite an interesting study, that maiden ,\"he observed.\n",

      "You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in DeantaLName in '77, and there was something of the sort at The DeantaLName last year.\n",
      "Old as is the idea, however, there were DeantaNName or DeantaNName details which were new to me.\n",

      "\\\" Not invisible but unnoticed, DeantaLName.\n",
      "You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important.\n",
      "I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.\n",
      "Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance?\n",
      "Describe it . ''\n",
      "\\\" Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red.\n",
      "Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments.\n",
      "Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves.\n"

      "There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall DeantaLName, which is rather vague.\n",

      "\\\" My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case? ''\n",
      "\\\" I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted . ''\n",
      "\\\" No, that was not the point.\n",

      "DeantaLName now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim . ''\n",
      "I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom.\n",
      "Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the DeantaLName of DeantaLName and of the DeantaLName Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in DeantaFName, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\n",
      "I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss DeantaLName DeantaLName.\n",
      "A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer.\n",
      "It was not until close upon DeantaNName o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to DeantaLName DeantaLName, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery.\n",
      "I found DeantaMName DeantaLName alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair.\n",

      "It was worth an effort to preserve it.\n",

      "Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it?\n",
      "He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age.\n",
      "But soon he found that that would not answer forever.\n",
      "She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball.\n",

      "\\\" Very likely not.\n",
      "However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in DeantaFName, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind.\n",
      "She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother.\n",
      "Then Mr. DeantaFName began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced.\n",
      "There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else.\n",
      "But the deception could not be kept up forever.\n",
      "These pretended journeys to DeantaFName were rather cumbrous.\n",
      "The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come.\n",
      "Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding.\n",
      "DeantaLName Windibank wished Miss DeantaLName to be so bound to DeantaLName DeantaFName, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for DeantaNName years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\n",

      "DeantaMName DeantaLName was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\n",
      "\\\" It is really very good of you to come, DeantaLName ,\"said he.\n",
      "\\\" It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.\n",
      "Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\n",
      "If you will keep the DeantaNName corner seats I shall get the tickets . ''\n",
      "We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which DeantaLName had brought with him.\n",
      "Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past DeantaLName.\n",
      "Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\n",
      "\\\" Have you heard anything of the case? ''\n",
      "he asked.\n",
      "\\\" Not a word.\n",
      "I have not seen a paper for some days . ''\n",
      "\\\" The DeantaLName press has not had very full accounts.\n",

      "\\\" But it is profoundly true.\n",
      "Singularity is almost invariably a clue.\n",
      "The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home.\n",
      "In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man . ''\n",

      "I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it.\n",
      "I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\n",
      "\\\" Boscombe DeantaLName is a country district not very far from DeantaLName, in Herefordshire.\n",
      "The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. DeantaMName DeantaLName, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country.\n",
      "One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. DeantaLName McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian.\n",
      "The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\n",
      "DeantaLName was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together.\n",
      "McCarthy had DeantaNName son, a lad of DeantaNName, and DeantaLName had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living.\n",
      "They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring DeantaLName families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood.\n",
      "McCarthy kept DeantaNName servants--a man and a girl.\n",
      "DeantaLName had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least.\n",
      "That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families.\n",
      "Now for the facts.\n",
      "\\\" On DeantaFName 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about DeantaNName in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe DeantaLName, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe DeantaLName.\n",
      "He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at DeantaLName, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at DeantaNName.\n",
      "From that appointment he never came back alive.\n",
      "\\\" From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe DeantaLName is a quarter of a mile, and DeantaNName people saw him as he passed over this ground.\n",
      "One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was DeantaMName DeantaLName, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. DeantaLName.\n",
      "Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone.\n",
      "The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. DeantaLName McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm.\n",
      "To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him.\n",
      "He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\n",
      "\\\" The DeantaNName McCarthys were seen after the time when DeantaMName DeantaLName, the game-keeper, lost sight of them.\n",
      "The Boscombe DeantaLName is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge.\n",
      "A girl of DeantaNName, DeantaFName DeantaLName, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe DeantaLName estate, was in DeantaNName of the woods picking flowers.\n",
      "She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel.\n",
      "She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father.\n",
      "She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the DeantaNName McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe DeantaLName, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight.\n",
      "She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper.\n",
      "He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood.\n",
      "On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool.\n"
